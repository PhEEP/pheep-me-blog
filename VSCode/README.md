# The code editor that makes it easier to be a better developer

You're likely to have a preference already on how your code editor works and looks for you. Here's a few extensions and some settings I use to make my life easier.

## Extensions

Theme: **Night Owl** `sdras.night-owl`

> A VS Code theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too, but this theme is fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. âœ¨

Icons: **VSCode Great Icons** `emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons`

> A big pack of icons (100+) for your files.

I love this icon pack, because it's clean and descriptive and works with light and dark themes.
