# VSCode, it's what I use

You're likely to have a preference already on how your code editor works and looks for you. Either click the link or search the extension (`ctl + shift + x`) and type what is after the link, e.g. `sdras.night-owl`

## Extensions

Think of these like powerups for your workspace!

### Aesthetics

Make it look how I like 😉, or choose your own...

#### Theme

[**Night Owl**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) `sdras.night-owl`

> A VS Code theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too, but this theme is fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. ✨

#### Theme for writing

[**Markdown Theme Kit**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.theme-markdownkit) `ms-vscode.theme-markdownkit`

I switch between the variations here depending on the lighting in the room I'm in. Right now it's dark in here so I'm using _Markdown Editor Dark_.

#### Icons

[**VSCode Great Icons**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons) `emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons`

> A big pack of icons (100+) for your files.

I love this icon pack, because it's clean and descriptive and works with light and dark themes. There are many different icon packs and you'll likely find one you like better than the others.

### Git

[**Git History**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory) `donjayamanne.githistory`

☝️ title. Basically this will give you great tools to explore the history of whatever repository you're in. I use it mostly to see how code looked like when it worked... 🙄

[**Git Project Manager**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipecaputo.git-project-manager) `felipecaputo.git-project-manager`

> Git Project Manager (GPM) is a Microsoft VSCode extension that allows you to open a new window targeting a git repository directly from VSCode window.

If you frequently work within different git repositories (at one point I was bouncing between 3 for one project...), this will index your repos and allow you to open them from your command palette.

[**Git Lens -- Git supercharged**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) `eamodio.gitlens`
