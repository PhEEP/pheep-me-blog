# Pheep Devs

Oh, hi there, thanks for dropping in! My real name is Philippe Moore, but my handle is Pheep. My favorite things are my family 👪, my pets 🐶 🐱 🐱, and learning new stuff 📚! That last one has lead me down the path from artist to creative technologist, to web developer. Along the way I've picked up a few things and formed some preferences on the way I like to work. This space is for condensing and clarifying that accumulated knowledge and hopefully making your next step that much easier to take! Hope you find what you're looking for, and if not, at least have some fun ;).
