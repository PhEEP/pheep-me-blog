# So you want to web dev on Windows

Anyone ever told you you can't be a _real_ web developer on a PC? Maybe you want to get started but feel gimped by the price of a Macbook? Maybe you are already a gamer, have a sweet rig and don't want to buy a separate computer?

Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) to the rescue!

Just want the steps? [Skip to the end](#just-the-steps)

## Assumptions

- Windows 10 Fall Creators Update
- You can interact with your computer
- Sense of humor optional

## Installation

Microsoft keeps pretty good docs on enabling WSL on your own machine, reference them [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Also check out this [HowToGeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) article that has a few extra tips.

Here's the quick and dirty for my setup.

### Step 1: Powershell

Open up Powershell as an administrator. If you've never done that, follow these instructions.

- Press the **Windows** key
- Type **Powershell**
- Right-click **Powershell**
- Select **Run as Administrator**
- Click **Yes** when prompted

You should see something like this (ignore the `ssh` stuff there, I'll figure that out later...)

Once you have an administrator-powered Powershell terminal open, paste the following command in and run it:

```shell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Congratulations, you're now a hacker!

### Step 2: Restart your computer

Restart it, and get used to that being the solution to a few of your problems. Seriously, if things just don't seem to be working correctly, go ahead and reboot. üëç

### Step 3: Pick your Linux distribution

I've been using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and recently had success upgrading to 18.04 LTS. This guide doesn't cover the upgrade process, so pick either `16.04` or `18.04` and let's roll üöÄ.

Head on over to the Microsoft Store (hit that **Windows** key again and search for `Microsoft Store`, hit enter). Search for `Linux` or `Ubuntu`, and install one of them.

## Just the steps

- Open Powershell as Administrator
- Enable WSL

```shell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

- Restart your computer
- Install [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6)
- Open Ubuntu from the start menu
- Create a new user, or just hit enter a few times to be root
  - I'm not exactly sure of any consequences here
- Scripts üëá, do them

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
# ... ‚òïÔ∏è
# Get essential build tools
sudo apt install -y build-essential
# Get `n` via `n-install`
curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
# close and reopen ubuntu / bash
node -v && npm -v
# Should see versions
# Get `yarn`
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
yarn -v
```
